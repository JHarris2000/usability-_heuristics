    <h2 id="step1" class="headings">Visibility of system status</h2>
    <p class="paragraphs">A system’s visibility of it’s status is very important because it gives quick feedback to the user to 
        ensure that they stay informed on what is happening on the application they are using. This allows 
        them to make decisions based on the information they see that may change what they want to do next. 
        Youtube shows this trait throughout its application for example if a user likes a video, as soon as 
        they click it the total likes on the video will go up one to include their like. This is good for 
        creators who want to look at results of their videos and how many likes or views to get in a specified time period.</p>

    <h2 id="step2" class="headings">Match between system and the real world</h2>
    <p class="paragraphs">Users can easily get confused on a site they never used before or are unfamiliar with. This is why 
        matching between systems and the real world is an efficient heuristic to ensure success on an 
        application. It makes the user feel more comfortable with the interface and will allow them to have 
        a more successful navigating and complete task on the system. Youtube shows this trait by favoring 
        the user’s recent searches, watched videos, likes, or subscriptions on the users homepage under 
        an “All recommendations” tab. This shows videos that the user is most likely interested in or 
        topics they have knowledge about making easier for them to find what they are looking for.

<h2 id=step3 class="headings">User control and freedom</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">Mistakes are inevitable, users are bound to make a mistake eventually, but it is important to have the 
    ability to also correct that mistake with a minimal inconvenience or difficulty to the user. The 
    harder it is for the user to go back and correct a mistake the more egregious that one mistake becomes. 
    Youtube includes the heuristic that gives the user an exit or a redo if a mistake does happen. A save and 
    close option is added if a user is attempting to upload a video to their channel, also the process 
    is broken up into steps and a “back” button is included if a user needs to change something on a previous 
    step with no penalty to their process. This gives the user room for error and doesn’t stress them out 
    about trying to be perfect.</p>

<h2 id="step4" class="headings">Consistency and standards</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">Consistency is key to how quickly users get accustomed to using an application. If an 
    application was inconsistent it would cause confusion and inefficiency and detour users 
    from wanting to use it. Youtube stays very consistent from channel to channel, it 
    doesn’t matter if you’re a million subscriber account or an under 100 subscriber 
    account. For example the main page for a verified ESPN account with 7 million subscribers 
    has the same layout as a non-verified account with 76 subscribers. Since all channels are 
    formatted the same way users will never be lost no matter what channel the end up on, 
    they’ll be able to know exactly where to go if they want to check a channel’s playlist, 
    or read more about the channel.</p>

<h2 id=step5 class="headings">Error prevention</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">The best way to fix mistakes is to prevent mistakes from happening in the first place. The better a 
    system includes checks or confirmations for users the less mistakes the user will make because it 
    will cause them to rethink what they are currently doing. Youtube includes confirmations on tasks 
    that will have a larger impact than others. For example if you want to watch a video you just need 
    to click the video and it plays with no cost to the user, but say a creator wants to delete a video 
    from their channel this task could potentially delete something they worked very hard on or gained 
    many likes and views on that could potentially profit from. The impacts of the two tasks are gravely 
    different. That's why the system ask the user if they are aware they are attempting to delete a 
    video and asks for them to check the box and click delete video to confirm the action.</p>
<p><img id="step5.1" class="pictures" src="Hueristics/Step5(1).jpg" alt="A picture of Youtube's deletion process for videos" width="1000" height="600"></p>

<h2 id=step6 class="headings">Recognition rather than recall</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">To improve usability it’s important not to ask too much from the user when the system could make tasks 
    for them easier. It would be unnecessary for a user to have to remember where everything is everytime 
    they use an application when a guide can be provided whenever they need it instead. Youtube addresses 
    this heuristics by allowing by holding a history library that includes every video the user has watched 
    in chronological order. This saves the user time trying to remember what was the name of that video they 
    watched a week ago, they could simply scroll until they see it search by dates. Say they may recall 
    watching a video, but don’t remember when, they can search keywords in their history that will bring up 
    the videos that it relates to.</p>

<h2 id=step7 class="headings">Flexibility and efficiency of use</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">A system built to incorporate the use by inexperienced and experienced users are the most successful because 
    it has the ability to range is usability between different users. The simplicity for the inexperienced users 
    and the ability to be more efficient and advanced for the experienced users is the perfect balance for a good 
    system. Youtube is a pretty simple platform, however for experienced users of the websites Youtube includes 
    “advanced settings” that can tweak their experience using the application even more than before and more to 
    their personal liking</p>
<p><img id="step7.1" class="pictures" src="Hueristics/Step7(1).jpg" alt="A Picture of the advanced settings tab on Youtube" width="1000" height="600"></p>

<h2 id=step8 class="headings">Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">A page with an overwhelming amount of information can scare users away or distract and confuse them from the tasks 
    they may be trying to perform. It is important for an interface to strictly show what’s needed and hide the 
    unnecessary things that users may not want to see. Youtube includes this heuristic by adding different types of 
    views while a user is watching a video. If it’s too much around the video they are attempting to watch they can 
    choose between three modes that expand their video and get rid of distractions to the point where the video can be 
    the only thing seen on the screen.</p>

<h2 id=step9 class="headings">Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">Error messages are essential for users to identify a problem and help find a solution to it. Error messages should explain 
    the error simply, but also thorough enough for the user to understand what the error is and how to fix it. Youtube includes 
    an error message if you are attempting to upload a video in the wrong format. The message is simple enough to know what’s 
    wrong, it includes a read more tab if the user needs more information about the error and solutions to it. Say the error 
    read “file won’t upload” instead, this description is more vague and may cause the user a harder time figuring out what the 
    problem is and how to find a solution.</p>

<h2 id=step10 class="headings">Help and documentation</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">Help documentations are a necessary feature to have for systems to provide information a user wants to search about the system 
    and answer what questions they may have. It is an easy way for users to seek help on specific topics that may not be included 
    in error messages, or any other checking form. Youtube includes a help document that a user can search specific topics or scroll 
    through the most popularly searched topics that may be a quicker way for the user to find their answer.</p>
